---------

recipes
^^^^^^^

* contains 7 API handlers (`register`, `login`, `recipes`, `favored`, `recipe_detail`, `vote_recipe`, `comment_recipe`) and 3 jinja-powered pages (recipes, recipe_detail, collect)
* API: logged in users can vote for recipe and comment it. for each recipe object they've got `liked` field - means if current user liked this recipe. liked recipes can be obtained by favored endpoint.
* non-API:  in `recipe_detail` non-api handler users can discuss recipe in chat using websockets. `collect` handler uses scrape app.
